Photography Website

1. The homepage will be similar to the twit website we've been working on in class.
2. Each card is a gallery and each card will have a preview picture with the name imposed on top of it.
3. The Navbar will have an "add gallery" on the homepage, but in each gallery it will have a Home button, search bar, and add picture button.
4. The footer will have a scroll menu where we can select each picture. Each picture will have a title and maybe a description.
5. The Home button on the navbar will take us back to the homepage.


## Note's By Ebraheem

1. Might Want to Scale Back on the Home Page being similar to the twit website because we don't need a bunch of html engulfing it.
2. The Navbar Might need a lot of NodeJS coding that might take too long to code.
3. I've got some basic index.js up but the only issue I'm having is how to add the Event Listers dynamically.
4. We can always scale back the currently thing if need be.
5. For testing purpose I've included Local Photos to work with. The G folder is to symbolize Galleries and G# symbolizes the number.
