Photography Website

1. The homepage will be similar to the twit website we've been working on in class.
2. Each card is a gallery and each card will have a preview picture with the name imposed on top of it.
3. The Navbar will have an "add gallery" on the homepage, but in each gallery it will have a Home button, search bar, and add picture button.
4. The footer will have a scroll menu where we can select each picture. Each picture will have a title and maybe a description.
5. The Home button on the navbar will take us back to the homepage.
